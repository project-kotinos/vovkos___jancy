Jancy Documentation Index
=========================

Jancy is a **scripting programming language** with the **LLVM** back-end. Jancy offers a lot of convenient features for low-level IO (input-output) and UI (user-interface) programming which are not found in mainstream languages (and sometimes, nowhere else). This includes **safe pointer** arithmetics, high level of source-level and ABI **compatibility with C**, **reactive programming**, built-in generator of **incremental lexers/scanners** and a lot more.
