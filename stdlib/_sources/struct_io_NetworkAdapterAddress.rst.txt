Detailed Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This struct holds information about single address of the network
adapter.

A list of network adapter addresses is part of network adapter description
stored in `io.NetworkAdapterDesc`.

Fields
------

.. index:: pair: variable; m_next
.. _doxid-struct_member_io_networkadapteraddress_m_next:

.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	io.NetworkAdapterAddress const* m_next

Holds a pointer to the next newtwork adatper address or ``null`` if this
is the last address.

.. index:: pair: variable; m_address
.. _doxid-struct_member_io_networkadapteraddress_m_address:

.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	:ref:`io.SocketAddress<doxid-type_io_socketaddress>` m_address

Holds address of the network adapter as `io.SocketAddress`. ``m_port``
field of the address should obviously be ignored.

.. index:: pair: variable; m_netMaskBitCount
.. _doxid-struct_member_io_networkadapteraddress_m_netmaskbitcount:

.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	:ref:`size_t<doxid-typedef_size_t>` m_netMaskBitCount

The length, in bits, of the prefix or network part of the IP address.
For a unicast IPv4 address, any value greater than 32 is an illegal
value. For a unicast IPv6 address, any value greater than 128 is an
illegal value.
