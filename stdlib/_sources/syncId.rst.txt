syncId Model Explanation
========================

When working with asynchronous IO interfaces, you need to take care of one subtle issue.

Let's say, you have an IO stream such as `io.FileStream` or `io.Socket` and you have assigned your IO event handler. This event handler is originally called from within the internal IO thread, but may be postponed should you assign some *scheduler*).

The problem is, how to synchronize your main thread (from which you call ``open``, ``write`` etc) and the event handler? Who knows, maybe the *event* happened moments ago, before the latest ``close`` on the IO stream, but your *event handler* was invoked just now?

To deal with this issue, all asynchronous  IO classes provide ``m_syncId`` field and sequentially increments it upon every ``close`` and ``open``. In your event handler you should compare ``m_syncId`` of the IO stream and ``m_syncId`` of event params. If there is a mismatch, simply ignore this event -- it was originated from the previous IO stream session.

``m_syncId`` is a public read-write field, so you can also increment it manually, to identify certain *stages* in your session.
